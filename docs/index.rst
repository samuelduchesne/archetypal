archetypal |version|
====================

`archetypal` is a Python package designed with the objective of helping building energy modelers and researchers
maintain collections of building archetypes. `archetypal` depends on `eppy`_ for EnergyPlus models and makes use of
great packages such as `pandas`_ for data structure processing and `tsam`_ for time series aggregation.

Description
===========

As building energy modelers ourselves, we found it was sometimes difficult to use scripting language to retrieve,
modify, simulate and analyze Building Energy Models (BEM). This is why `archetypal` was created. We built two main
capabilities into the package:

1. The conversion of EnergyPlus to `TRNBuild <http://sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys/index.html>`_ models (shout out to TRNSYS users!)
2. The conversion of EnergyPlus to `UMI <http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/umi/index.html>`_ Template Files.

`archetypal` also features a :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI)<Command reference>` which means that users can execute
commands in the terminal instead of writing a python script. In addition, we believe reproducible research through
Jupyter Notebooks, for instance, is the way foreword. Therefore, all the modules are discoverable and can be imported
independently.
