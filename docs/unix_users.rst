For MacOS/Linux users
=====================

MacOS or Linux users must install Wine_ before running archetypal. This software
will allow MacOS/Linux users to run Windows application (e.g. `trnsidf.exe`).

Wine installation
-----------------

1. In the Terminal, you have to install Homebrew with the following command line:

.. code-block:: python

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You will have to confirm this action by pressing enter. The Terminal might ask your password,
then you have to enter the Admin password (followed by :guilabel:`&Enter: ‚èé`). The installation of Homebrew
should take few seconds or minutes.

2. After installing Homebrew, you have to run 'brew doctor' (the Terminal might ask you)
with the following command line:

.. code-block:: python

    brew doctor

This action will make Homebrew inspected your system to make sure the installation is correctly set up

3. Then you will need to install Xquartz using Homebrew by typing the following command line:

.. code-block:: python

    brew cask install xquartz

4. Finally you can install Wine by copying the following command line:

.. code-block:: python

    brew install wine

Using WINE with ``archetypal convert`` command
----------------------------------------------

The IDF to BUI converter uses an executable installed with TRNSYS (which is Windows only). Users that have bought
TRNSYS can copy the trnsidf.exe executable to their UNIX machine (MacOs or Linux) and invoke the `archetypal convert`
command with the :option:`--trnsidf_exe` option.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    archetypal convert --trnsidf-exe "<path to executable on UNIX machine>" "<path to IDF file>"

You can find the executable trnsidf.exe in the TRNSYS default installation folder:
`C:\\TRNSYS18\\Building\\trnsIDF`
